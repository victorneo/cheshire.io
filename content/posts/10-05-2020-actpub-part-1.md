## Let's Federate on ActivityPub

ActivityPub is a [protocol for decentralized social networks][1] to that allows
federation - imagine servers running their own instances of "Twitter" that can
speak with each other, across domains.

The screenshot below shows a toots and its replies on [Mastodon][2], a
Twitter-like social network that supports ActivityPub:

Supporting users across federated platforms introduces some interesting
problems: posting updates, following / unfollowing users.

In this series of blog posts, I will be documenting my journey in building a
simple server that federates with ActivityPub servers. It will be a fun journey
to figure out how other implementations work.

If you are interested in learning more, it might be easier (and faster) to
check out existing implementations (next section) or check out
[activitypub.rocks][4].

## Existing Implementations

[Fediverse.party][5] documents a list of decentralized social platforms, some
of which are not ActivityPub compatible (eg. the once wildly popular
[Disapora][6]).

The most popular ActivityPub federated network would be [Mastodon][2], which
became popular when ActivityPub received the W3C Recommendation status. You
will have to choose which instances of Mastodon to join though.

Some others include [Pleroma][7], a blogging platform, [write.as][8] and
[MissKey][9] which is very popular with Japanese users.

## Implementation

The [Guide for new ActivityPub implementators][10] is the best place to start
right and what I will follow, and where you should start if you are ever
implementing your own. [ActivityPub as it has been understood][11] is another
good reference with some good references.

Unfortunately, the official test suite has been [down for a while][12] and will
continue to be for a while, but fortunately a [new one is in the works][13].
For testing purposes at the moment, we will attempt to federate with Mastodon
and its ActivityPub implementation.

You can follow my progress on this repository: [Soda][14]. There's currently
only one or two working API endpoints for testing out how Following APIs work.

## Let's Begin: Let's Follow Someone

The [official website][4] has a reference image for a really high-level
overview of how Federation works for ActivityPub:

![ActivityPub Overview](/images/actpub/actpub-overview.png)
<center>_[High-level Overview of ActivityPub][3]_</center>

Most interactions between servers that Federate would be over the `/inbox`
endpoint - except for the initial user discovery. Here is a quick sequence of
interactions when I search for a user on a remote server to follow on Mastodon:

* Server A sends a [webfinger][15] request to the remote server (Server B) to
  identify the user
* Server B replies with the user's information
* Server A shows the user's information, and thumbnail
* Server A sends a follow request to Server B when a user clicks Follow to the
  user's `/inbox` address
* Server B replies with an Follow object to indicate that following is approved

<center>_[Mastodon User Search UI][3]_</center>

The webfinger request returns the following response from Mastodon when I query
for my own account:

```
{
  "subject":"acct:victorneo@mastodon.social",
  "aliases":[
    "https://mastodon.social/@victorneo",
    "https://mastodon.social/users/victorneo"
  ],
  "links":[
    {
      "rel":"http://webfinger.net/rel/profile-page",
      "type":"text/html",
      "href":"https://mastodon.social/@victorneo"
    },
    {
      "rel":"self",
      "type":"application/activity+json",
      "href":"https://mastodon.social/users/victorneo"
    },
    {
      "rel":"http://ostatus.org/schema/1.0/subscribe",
      "template":"https://mastodon.social/authorize_interaction?uri={uri}"
    }
  ]
}
```

After getting this response, any server would know that they can access my
profile information by looking for the link that points to `self` and
of the `application/activity+json` type.

Querying the endpoint (with HTTP header `Accept: application/activity+json`),
you will get the following response:

```
{  "@context":["https://www.w3.org/ns/activitystreams",
    "https://w3id.org/security/v1",
    { "manuallyApprovesFollowers":"as:manuallyApprovesFollowers",
      "toot":"http://joinmastodon.org/ns#",
      "featured":{
        "@id":"toot:featured",
        "@type":"@id"
      },
      "alsoKnownAs":{
        "@id":"as:alsoKnownAs",
        "@type":"@id"
      },
      "movedTo":{
        "@id":"as:movedTo",
        "@type":"@id"
      },
      "schema":"http://schema.org#",
      "PropertyValue":"schema:PropertyValue",
      "value":"schema:value",
      "IdentityProof":"toot:IdentityProof",
      "discoverable":"toot:discoverable",
      "focalPoint":{
        "@container":"@list",
        "@id":"toot:focalPoint"
      }
    }
  ],
  "id":"https://mastodon.social/users/victorneo",
  "type":"Person",
  "following":"https://mastodon.social/users/victorneo/following",
  "followers":"https://mastodon.social/users/victorneo/followers",
  "inbox":"https://mastodon.social/users/victorneo/inbox",
  "outbox":"https://mastodon.social/users/victorneo/outbox",
  "featured":"https://mastodon.social/users/victorneo/collections/featured",
  "preferredUsername":"victorneo",
  "name":"Victor Neo",
  "summary":"\u003cp\u003eEngineering at Carousell. Passionate about the Open üï∏Ô∏è.\u003c/p\u003e",
  "url":"https://mastodon.social/@victorneo",
  "manuallyApprovesFollowers":false,
  "discoverable":true,
  "publicKey":{
    "id":"https://mastodon.social/users/victorneo#main-key",
    "owner":"https://mastodon.social/users/victorneo",
    "publicKeyPem":"-----BEGIN PUBLIC KEY-----\...\n-----END PUBLIC KEY-----\n"
  },
  "tag":[],
  "attachment":[],
  "endpoints":{
    "sharedInbox":"https://mastodon.social/inbox"
  },
  "icon":{
    "type":"Image",
    "mediaType":"image/jpeg",
    "url":"https://files.mastodon.social/accounts/avatars/000/077/572/original/a79a3b7bf7011af0.jpg"

  }
}
```

Parsing the response, another server can send a [Follow request][16] to
`https://mastodon.social/users/victorneo/inbox` to be processed.

More to come in part 2!
