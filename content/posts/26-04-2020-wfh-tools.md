description: "A collection of Tools and Tips from my COVID-19 WFH Experience"
---

Most people working in the tech industry should be familiar with the concept of
working from home, albeit periodically. It is a slightly different when it
becomes a daily affair without an option for actual face-to-face time with your
colleagues.

I suspect that most people will probably walk out of this experience
reinforcing their beliefs that a 100% remote work environment is the _only_ way
of life going forward for them, or hate remote work so much that they will
never want to work in a 100% remote company.

Regardless of your current preference towards working from home, here are a
couple of tools and tips I have collected over the past few weeks that would
hopefully would make your lives easier.

## Video Calls

### Getting Zoom Features on Hangouts

Video calls over Zoom / Hangouts / Meet will remain the only way for most
people to stay connected during this period of time. If you are using Hangouts
Meet like us at Carousell, there are a couple of browser extensions that you
can use to recreate the Zoom experience for free.

The Grid View plugin for [Chrome][1] and [Firefox][2] is a great addition to
help you recreate that grid experience from Zoom. If you want the ability to
add live reactions and "hands-up" reactions, [Nod for Hangouts Meet][3] can
help with that.

The bad news is that everyone needs to install these extensions to benefit from
them. The good news, however, is that Hangouts Meet will be rolling out its own
native Grid view in the coming weeks, so at least one of these extensions will
not be necessary soon. Hopefully Google will continue to ship more new features
during this period of time and finally catch up with Zoom.

### Audio Quality and Noise Cancellation

Perhaps it's due to the influx of online influencers using their [Yeti][4]
microphones, but I find it difficult to believe that people will follow
recommendations where they are told to buy expensive microphones to enhance
their voice over video calls. The reality is that most of us will probably be
working in environments that are not ideal for video calls at home, especially
if you are staying with others or have kids running around.

A high end microphone won't work if you are stressed out by noises around the
house. In fact, it might even pick up sounds that would normally not be caught
by the earphones that come with your phone.

I do about 3-6 hours worth of video calls everyday, and for all of them, I use
a set of [cheap earphones][6] that I bought from Xiaomi a couple years back and
it works super well coupled with Krisp. And trust me - it's much better for
both the speaker and listeners if you use a earphone or wireless one compared
to the built-in one in your laptop. Unless you are using the [16" Macbook Pro][7].

Fortunately, there is a salvation for us working in environments with random
noises. [Krisp][5] is a software that you can install on your macOS, Windows,
or iOS devices that will perform noise cancellation for you automatically,
using AI models that they have built.

In Singapore, our Air Force frequently does air drills in the air which can
create quite a bit of background noise. My best record so far has been going
thru 3 different military aircrafts flying past my house in a single hour, and
that made me scramble to mute my mic to avoid disrupting others.  Fortunately
for me, Krisp can block all the loud noises from the plane so I don't have to
mute myself (in fact, I rarely mute myself unless I need to step away).

## Work Async, But Find Ways to Connect

### Async, not Sync

If you and your team are not used to working remote, it can easily feel
disconnected from them. I am not definitely __not keen__ on presence-based
video tools such as [PukkaTeam][8] and [Sneek][9]. (Huge) Privacy concerns
aside, it creates an environment where managers can use to check if their
team members are at work or not. It could work for well for team members
without their managers though, if they wish to use it. Slack works well
enough for us, and I rarely tag someone in my team's channel.

![Document Writing](/images/wfh-tips/doc-list.png)

Remote has an excellent [article on working asynchronously][10] that you should
take a look. Rather than get into video meetings about certain topics,
well-crafted documents are preferred. It forces you to think through your ideas
and concepts, and it allows your readers to go through the document and comment
on their own time. After that, a meeting can be held to go through the document
and follow-ups.

### Find Ways to Connect

Team activities are the best way to stay connected. Some teams at Carousell
have started sessions where they play games online, agendaless meetings where
they chat about how life has been since they started working from home.

My team will be doing our first team activity in one week later where we will
reveal our [16 personalities][11] in a workshop facilitated by our amazing HR
Business Partner. The intent of this session is actually less on our individual
personalities (it's still fun to know), but more about carving out time to talk
about stuff that is not related to work.

## WFH At Your Schedule

### Adjust Your Schedules

Working from home during the COVID-19 period can be challenging if you need to
take care of family members, especially those who need special care and
attention.

If you need changes to your working hours to get by, be sure to speak with your
team and manager and see what can be done. Our CTO took the lead by announcing
that he will be working earlier hours in the day so that he can take care of
his kids in the afternoon while his wife works.

I personally embrace this period of time by taking [power naps][12] when I get
15-20 minutes blocks of time, especially if it's a particularly challenging day
with lots of meetings. It's definitely not something I get a chance to do in
office, and I wake up feeling refreshed and ready for the next meeting.

### Stay Active

To avoid sinking into the trap of working non-stop, I set up my bicycle and
[indoor trainer][13] to be literally right beside me so that I can hop on and
ride anytime on [Zwift][14]. I bought the trainer more than a month ago when I
saw the situation evolving, and it turns out to be the right choice as I no
longer need to head out to cycle.

There are plenty of [HIIT workouts on Youtube][15] that you can do without any
equipment. Do a couple of reps and you can go back to eating those chips and
snacks you know you stocked up on.


## Other Notable Mentions

- I bought [magnet][18] in the past when it was on sale, but now that it no longer works on Catalina, I have switched to [Rectangle][19], which is almost the same and open source!
- [Notion][20] is my current GOTO tool for tracking TODOs and writing documents. Works better than other personal TODO tools in my opinion
- [Pinafore][21], if you use Mastodon for tooting.


## That's all I have for now

I hope you found something helpful in this post. For me, the biggest lifesaver
has been Krisp - and I only came across it in a [blog post by a teacher][16] on
teaching remotely online.

If you have tips you wish to share with me, [let me know on Twitter][17]!
