Hello. I am Victor, and I am based in sunny
[Singapore](https://goo.gl/maps/1dW9WEpN43n7wRQi9).

I head up the Engineering team at [Carousell](https://careers.carousell.com),
and spend a bit of my time reading through studies and books on management, and
primarily use this blog to share my thoughts on them.

If you are looking for book recommendations on Management or Engineering
Management, you can check out my [GoodReads list](https://www.goodreads.com/review/list/23479859-victor-neo?shelf=management&sort=rating)
to see what are the top books that I have read and would highly recommend. 5
stars are reserved for books that I highly recommend.

Mysteries and thrillers books are my favourite, so I do have a list to track
those that I have read as well.
- [Mysteries /
  Thrillers](https://www.goodreads.com/review/list/23479859-victor-neo?shelf=mysteries)
